A program to do two functions.  The first functions are to query Twitter every x amount of time to see if the WiFi is
down in a certain area within Georgetown University based upon pre-defined geo-locations.  It will then determine if
the WiFi is down based upon how many times the code finds tweets with certain key words/phrases, and then insert into
the database for the front-end to then pull that to the user screen.  The second set of functions are for catching any
tweets with a specific pre-define hashtag to let the app know where WiFi is down.
